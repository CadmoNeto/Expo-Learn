# Hello Folks!!
## This is my React Native study project <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/react/react-original.svg" width="30" height="30" />

I have created this repository to start my studies in React Native.
I started to learn React using Expo as a recommendation from one of my friends.
I use this repository to develop my skills, learn new things and challenge myself to evolve as a programmer.
I'm looking foward to become better developer, so I can get good opportunities of remote jobs from outside my country (Brasil).

You can keep in touch with me in my LinkedIn, there you can send me new challenges and tips. I would be extremelly grateful!! <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cadmo-nascimento-27023a162/"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/linkedin/linkedin-original.svg" /></a>

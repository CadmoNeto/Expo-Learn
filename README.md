# Hello Folks!!
## This is my React Native study project <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/react/react-original.svg" width="30" height="30" />

I have created this repository to start my studies in React Native, i have decided to start my studies in React using Expo following a recommendation from one of my friends that works with it.
I use this repository to develop my skills, learn new things and challenge myself to evolve as a programmer as I'm looking foward to become better developer, so I can fullfill my current goal of get good opportunities of remote jobs from outside my country (Brasil).

### You can keep in touch with me in my LinkedIn, there you can send me new challenges and tips. I would be extremelly grateful!! <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cadmo-nascimento-27023a162/"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/linkedin/linkedin-original.svg" width="30" height="30" /></a>
